# Rust Documentation

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read
is the introduction to the book, [The Rust Programming
Language][book]. It will give you a good idea of what Rust is like,
show you how to install it, and explain its syntax and concepts. Upon
completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust developer, and
will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind Rust.

## Learning Rust

[The Rust Programming Language][book]. Also known as "The Book",
The Rust Programming Language is the most comprehensive resource for
all topics related to Rust, and is the primary official document of
the language.

[Rust by Example][rbe]. A collection of self-contained Rust
examples on a variety of topics, executable in-browser.

[Frequently asked questions][faq].

[The Rustonomicon][nomicon]. An entire book dedicated to
explaining how to write unsafe Rust code. It is for advanced Rust
programmers.

[rust-learning]. A community-maintained collection of resources
for learning Rust.
