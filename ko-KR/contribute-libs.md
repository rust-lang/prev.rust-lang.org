# Rust에 기여하기 &mdash; 라이브러리

If you want to contribute to Rust by writing volumes of Rust code,
then libraries are where it's at: since Rust is a young language,
there are many types of libraries that either do not exist yet
or are incomplete and in need of improvement or competition.

Deciding what to write that will have impact and be fun is a common
difficulty. Here are some ideas:

* Read and participate in the weekly "what's everyone working on
  this week" threads on [/r/rust] and [users.rust-lang.org]. These are
  packed with exciting announcements from other Rust programmers in
  need of collaborators.
* Familiarize yourself with the best Rust libraries through
  [awesome-rust] and [libs.rs].
* Some larger projects, including the web browser [Servo], the HTTP
  library [hyper], the source-formatter [rustfmt], the Unix library bindings
  [nix], and the lint collection [clippy], tag issues with 'easy' labels for new
  contributors.
* Get involved with one of the active Rust-oriented GitHub
  organizations, such as [PistonDevelopers], [servo], [redox-os],
  [iron], [contain-rs], [hyperium]. It's often easier to find a place
  to fit in with these subcommunities, they are in greater need of
  help than rust-lang itself, and they are filled with experienced
  Rust developers to guide you.
* Help guide libraries from [rust-lang-nursery] into rust-lang proper.
  Unfortunately there is not much documentation on what needs to be
  done here; ask on [#rust-libs].
* Inspect the RFC issue tracker for a [requested community
  library][requested] and build it.
* Watch [Github Trending][trending] for currently active Rust projects.

As a library author you will want to be aware of the [best practices
for Rust libraries][lib-prac].

Meet other Rust library designers in [#rust-libs].
